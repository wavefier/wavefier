subtitle: Dissecting Wavefier's Modular Structure
---

A modular framework is well suited to meet Wavefier's requirements to build a multi-messenger framework which can be leveraged by scientists. Containerization enables portability and scalability in a resource efficient context along with the possibility of fast development and deployment. Moreover, Wavefier's architecture allows the user to customize the pipeline by introducing additional containers to analyse data from different astrophysical domains.

Let's delve into Wavefier's base modules one by one.

## Wavefier importers
## Wavefier alert dispatchers
## Wavefier trigger handler
## Wavefier WDF
## Wavefier common
## Wavefier ML
Currently in development phase, this module will provide a machine-learning driven pipeline to analyse multi-messenger data imported into Wavefier.
