subtitle: A framework for multi-messenger astronomy
---

The **Wavefier** project was born with the aim of building a portable framework to run analysis of multi-messenger data from astophyiscal source. 

### Multi-messenger Astronomy
An event in the Universe is referred to as *multi-messenger* when it emits a variety of signals that can be detected by observatories
and instruments on Earth and in space. A typical multi-messenger event can be detected through different observation channels:
- Electromagnetic radiation(EM)
- Gravitational waves (GW)
- Neutrinos and antineutrinos
- Cosmic ray particles

Worldwide scientific collaborations study these channels by setting up and maintaining large and complex experiments which collect data fed to their analysis pipeline.
