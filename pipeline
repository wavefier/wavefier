A modular framework is well suited to meet Wavefier's requirements to build a multi-messenger framework which can be leveraged by scientists.
Containerization enables portability and scalability in a resource efficient context along with the possibility of fast development and deployment.
Moreover, Wavefier's architecture allows the user to customize the pipeline by introducing additional containers to analyse data from different 
astrophysical domains.

Let's delve into Wavefier's bas modules one by one.
