**Wavefier** is a framework for Multi-Messenger Astronomy, result of an industrial-academic collaboration between the European Gravitational Observatory, CNRS – Center National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris acting on behalf of the Laboratoire d’Annecy de physique des particules – LAPP UMR n. 51814, and Trust-IT Services, carried out in the context of the Asterics / Obelics pnd EOSC Future projects of the European Union’s H2020 Programme.

The Principal Investigator for the Wavefier project is Elena Cuoco, Ph.D.,  Head of Data Science Office @EGO-Virgo  “European Gravitational Observatory” 
This github repository is meant to update the Wavefier project in time, in order to provide the general public with an easy-to-access overview of the project, its scientific goals, software architecture, and progress tracking in time.

Check out the website [here] (https://wavefier.github.io/wavefier/), and please be patient if the website is in its initial stages. We are a small, yet dedicated team.
